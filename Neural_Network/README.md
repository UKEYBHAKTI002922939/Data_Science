## Unveiling the Power of Feedforward Neural Networks: A Dive into Artificial Intelligence

This repository delves into the fascinating world of **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)**, a fundamental building block of Artificial Intelligence. Explore how these networks learn complex patterns and make predictions by mimicking the human brain.

### What are Feedforward Neural Networks?

FNNs are artificial intelligence models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of interconnected layers of nodes, called neurons, that process information and learn from data.

### Key Features of FNNs:

* **Layered architecture:** Information flows in one direction, from the input layer through hidden layers to the output layer.
* **Nonlinear activation functions:** These functions introduce non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs.
* **Learning through backpropagation:** This algorithm adjusts the weights between neurons based on the difference between the predicted and actual output, enabling the network to improve its performance over time.

### Explore the Code:

This repository provides:

* **Implementation of a simple FNN using Python libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.**
* **Visualizations of the network architecture and activation functions.**
* **Training and testing the FNN on various datasets, showcasing its learning capabilities.**
* **Evaluation of the network's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.**
