## SVM Classification: Mastering the Support Vector Frontier

This repository delves into the powerful world of Support Vector Machines (SVM), a widely used algorithm for classification tasks. Explore how SVMs leverage the concept of maximum margin to achieve efficient and robust performance.

### Unveiling SVM:

SVM algorithms map data points to higher dimensional spaces, enabling them to find optimal separating hyperplanes that maximize the margin between different classes. This translates to superior generalization performance on unseen data.

### Kernel Power: Unveiling Hidden Structures:

While SVMs are inherently linear, they can be equipped with various kernel functions to handle non-linear relationships in data. This repository explores three key kernels:

* **Linear Kernel:** This simple kernel operates directly in the original data space, suitable for problems with inherently linear relationships.
* **Gaussian Kernel:** This powerful kernel projects data points to a higher dimensional space using a Gaussian function, allowing SVM to handle complex non-linear relationships.
* **Polynomial Kernel:** This versatile kernel maps data to a higher dimensional polynomial space, offering flexibility for handling various non-linear patterns.

### Dive into the Code:

This repository provides:

* Implementations of SVM classification with different kernel functions using Python libraries like scikit-learn.
* Visualizations of the decision boundaries and support vectors for each kernel.
* Interactive visualizations with libraries like Plotly or Bokeh for a deeper understanding of the kernel effects.
* Comparisons of the performance of different kernels on real-world datasets.
