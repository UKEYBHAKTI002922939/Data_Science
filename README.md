## Data Science Exploration: A Journey Through Diverse Techniques

This repository serves as a playground for exploring various data science techniques, encompassing:

* **Regression:**
    * Linear Regression: Building a linear relationship between independent and dependent variables for prediction tasks.
    * Polynomial Regression: Modeling non-linear relationships by adding polynomial terms to the equation.
* **Clustering:**
    * K-Means: Grouping data points into clusters based on their similarities, defined by K pre-determined centroids.
    * Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM): Modeling data distribution using a mixture of Gaussian components for more nuanced cluster representation.
* **CNN:**
    * Convolutional Neural Networks: Extracting features and patterns from visual data for object recognition and image classification.
* **ResNet:**
    * Deep Residual Neural Networks: Addressing the vanishing gradient problem in deep learning for improved image classification performance.
* **Decision Tree:**
    * A tree-like structure for classification, making predictions based on conditional rules derived from data attributes.
* **Random Forest:**
    * Combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting, offering robust classification capabilities.
* **Disease Prediction:**
    * Implementing five different methods to predict the onset or risk of various diseases based on patient data.
