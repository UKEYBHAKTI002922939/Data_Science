## Exploring Machine Learning Techniques for Classification: A Comparative Analysis

This repository delves into the world of machine learning classification by comparing the performance of five popular algorithms on a chosen dataset. 

**Included algorithms:**

* **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** This powerful algorithm finds the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes with the maximum margin, leading to robust and effective classification.
* **Decision Tree:** This intuitive algorithm utilizes a series of decision rules to split the data into progressively smaller groups, making it easily interpretable and suitable for understanding the model's reasoning.
* **Random Forest:** This ensemble technique combines multiple decision trees, leveraging their strengths to improve overall accuracy and reduce overfitting.
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** This simple yet versatile approach classifies data points based on the majority class of their closest neighbors, offering fast and efficient classification.
* **Logistic Regression:** This probabilistic model predicts the probability of an event occurring, making it suitable for binary classification tasks where understanding the likelihood of each outcome is crucial.

**Dataset:**

This repository focuses on the Disease Prediction Dataset.Complete Dataset consists of 2 CSV files . One of them is training and other is for testing your model. Each file has 133 columns, 132 of these columns are symptoms that a person experiences and last column is the prognosis. These symptoms are mapped to 42 diseases you can classify these set of symptoms to.

**Comparison Metrics:**

* **Accuracy:** This metric measures the overall percentage of correctly classified data points.
* **Precision:** This metric assesses the proportion of true positives among all identified positives.
* **Recall:** This metric evaluates the proportion of true positives identified among all actual positives.
* **F1-score:** This harmonic mean of precision and recall provides a balanced view of the model's performance.

**Repository Contents:**

* **Implementations of the five aforementioned classification algorithms in Python.**
* **Preprocessing and cleaning scripts for the chosen dataset.**
* **Evaluation and comparison of the models' performance using various metrics.**
* **Visualizations of the results and decision boundaries (for applicable models).**
