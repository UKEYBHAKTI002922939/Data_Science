## ResNet for CIFAR-10: A Deep Dive into Image Classification

This repository explores the application of ResNet, a powerful deep learning architecture, for classifying images in the CIFAR-10 dataset. Delve into the world of residual connections and discover their impact on model performance and accuracy.

**What is ResNet?**

ResNet stands for Residual Neural Network. It tackles the vanishing gradient problem that arises in deep neural networks by introducing skip connections. These connections directly add the input of a layer to its output, facilitating easier information flow and allowing the network to learn from features across different depths.

**Why CIFAR-10?**

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 tiny images categorized into 10 classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck). This dataset provides a well-established benchmark for testing and evaluating image classification models.

**What You'll Find Here:**
