## Exploring Cifar-10 with Pretrained CNN Models

This repository provides an exciting opportunity to delve into the world of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and explore their application in classifying images from the Cifar-10 dataset.

### What is a CNN?

CNNs are a type of artificial intelligence model particularly adept at analyzing and interpreting visual data. Inspired by the structure and function of the human visual system, they utilize a series of convolutional layers to extract features and patterns from images. By combining these features, CNNs can effectively classify images into different categories.

### Unveiling the Power of Pretrained Models:

This repository offers access to **pretrained CNN models** trained on the Cifar-10 dataset. These models have already learned to distinguish between the various object classes present in the dataset, saving you from the intensive training process.

### Explore the Code:

This repository offers:

* **Implementation of image classification using pretrained CNN models.**
* **Visualizations of the CNN architecture and feature maps.**
* **Demonstration of the model's performance on the Cifar-10 dataset.**
* **Analysis of the model's predictions and identification of potential biases.**

### Getting Started:
